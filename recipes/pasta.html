        <p><em>Delicious creamy Pasta Carbonara</em></p>
        <p>An exquisite mixture of cream, pasta, beacon and eggs</p>

        <p class="instructions">Ingredients :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound bacon, cut into small pieces.</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature.</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy cream, at room temperature.</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>16 ounces dry fettuccine pasta.</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, softened.</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley.</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ol class="instructions">Directions :</ol>
        <li>Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat together eggs and cream in a medium bowl until just blended. Stir in Parmesan cheese and set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add softened butter to the pot and toss with pasta until butter is melted. Add bacon and egg-cheese mixture. Stir until the heat of pasta cooks eggs, then garnish with parsley and black pepper to serve.</li>
